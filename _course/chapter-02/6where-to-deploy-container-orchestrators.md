Most container orchestrators can be deployed on the infrastructure of our choice - on bare metal, Virtual Machines, on-premise, or the public cloud. Kubernetes, for example, can be deployed on a workstation, with or without a local hypervisor such as Oracle VirtualBox, inside a company's data center, in the cloud on AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, Google Compute Engine (GCE) VMs, DigitalOcean Droplets, OpenStack, etc.

There are turnkey solutions which allow Kubernetes clusters to be installed, with only a few commands, on top of cloud Infrastructures-as-a-Service, such as GCE, AWS EC2, Docker Enterprise, IBM Cloud, Rancher, VMware, Pivotal, and multi-cloud solutions through IBM Cloud Private and StackPointCloud.

Last but not least, there is the managed container orchestration as-a-Service, more specifically the managed Kubernetes as-a-Service solution, offered and hosted by the major cloud providers, such as [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) (GKE), [Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) (Amazon EKS), [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/) (AKS), [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service), [DigitalOcean Kubernetes](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/), [Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes](https://cloud.oracle.com/containers/kubernetes-engine), etc. These shall be explored in one of the later chapters.
