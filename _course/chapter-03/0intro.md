In this chapter, we will explain what **Kubernetes** is, its features, and the reasons why you should use it. We will explore the evolution of Kubernetes from **Borg**, which is a cluster manager created by Google. 

We will also talk about the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation** **(CNCF)**, which currently hosts the Kubernetes project, along with other cloud-native projects, like Prometheus, Fluentd, rkt, containerd, etc.
