The **controller managers** are control plane components on the master node running controllers to regulate the state of the Kubernetes cluster. Controllers are watch-loops continuously running and comparing the cluster's desired state (provided by objects' configuration data) with its current state (obtained from etcd data store via the API server). In case of a mismatch corrective action is taken in the cluster until its current state matches the desired state.

The **kube-controller-manager** runs controllers responsible to act when nodes become unavailable, to ensure pod counts are as expected, to create endpoints, service accounts, and API access tokens.

The **cloud-controller-manager** runs controllers responsible to interact with the underlying infrastructure of a cloud provider when nodes become unavailable, to manage storage volumes when provided by a cloud service, and to manage load balancing and routing.
