Once we decide on the installation type, we also need to make some infrastructure-related decisions, such as:

-   Should we set up Kubernetes on bare metal, public cloud, or private cloud?
-   Which underlying OS should we use? Should we choose RHEL, CoreOS, CentOS, or something else?
-   Which networking solution should we use?
-   And so on.

Explore the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/) for details on choosing the right solution. Next, we will take a closer look at these solutions.
