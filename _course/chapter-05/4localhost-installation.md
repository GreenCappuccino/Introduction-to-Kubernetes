These are only a few localhost installation options available to deploy single- or multi-node Kubernetes clusters on our workstation/laptop:

-   [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/) - single-node local Kubernetes cluster
-   [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) - single-node local Kubernetes cluster for Windows and Mac
-   [CDK on LXD](https://www.ubuntu.com/kubernetes/docs/install-local) - multi-node local cluster with LXD containers.

Minikube is the preferred and recommended way to create an all-in-one Kubernetes setup locally. We will be using it extensively in this course.
