Kubernetes can be installed on-premise on VMs and bare metal.

-   **On-Premise VMs**\
    Kubernetes can be installed on VMs created via Vagrant, VMware vSphere, KVM, or another Configuration Management (CM) tool in conjunction with a hypervisor software. There are different tools available to automate the installation, such as [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) or [kubeadm](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm).
-   **On-Premise Bare Metal**\
    Kubernetes can be installed on on-premise bare metal, on top of different operating systems, like RHEL, CoreOS, CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu, etc. Most of the tools used to install Kubernetes on VMs can be used with bare metal installations as well.
