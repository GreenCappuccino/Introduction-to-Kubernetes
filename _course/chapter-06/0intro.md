As we mentioned in the previous chapter, [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/) is the easiest and most recommended way to run an all-in-one Kubernetes cluster locally on our workstations. In this chapter, we will explore the requirements to install Minikube locally on our workstation, together with the installation instructions to set it up on local Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems.
