In this chapter, we will study different methods of accessing a Kubernetes cluster. There are a variety of external clients or custom scripts that provide cluster access for administration purposes. We will use `kubectl` as a CLI tool to access the Minikube Kubernetes cluster, the **Kubernetes Dashboard** as a web-based user interface to interact with the cluster, and the `curl` command with the right credentials to access the cluster via APIs.
