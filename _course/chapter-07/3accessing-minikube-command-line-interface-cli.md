[kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) is the **Kubernetes Command Line Interface (CLI) client** to manage cluster resources and applications. It can be used standalone, or part of scripts and automation tools. Once all required credentials and cluster access points have been configured for `kubectl` it can be used remotely from anywhere to access a cluster. 

In later chapters, we will be using `kubectl` to deploy applications, manage and configure Kubernetes resources.
