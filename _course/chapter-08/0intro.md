In this chapter, we will explore the **Kubernetes object model** and discuss some of its fundamental building blocks, such as **Pods**, **ReplicaSets**, **Deployments**, **Namespaces**, etc. We will also discuss the essential role **Labels** and **Selectors** play in a microservices driven architecture as they group decoupled objects together.
