According to the [Kubernetes website](https://kubernetes.io/),

*"Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications."*

**Kubernetes** comes from the Greek word **κυβερνήτης**, which means *helmsman* or *ship pilot*. With this analogy in mind, we can think of Kubernetes as the pilot on a ship of containers.

Kubernetes is also referred to as **k8s**, as there are 8 characters between *k* and *s*.

Kubernetes is highly inspired by the Google Borg system, a container orchestrator for its global operations for more than a decade. It is an open source project written in the Go language and licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

Kubernetes was started by Google and, with its v1.0 release in July 2015, Google donated it to the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF). We will talk more about CNCF later in this chapter.

New Kubernetes versions are released in 3 months cycles. The current stable version is 1.14 (as of May 2019).
