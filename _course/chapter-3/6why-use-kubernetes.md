In addition to its fully-supported features, Kubernetes is also portable and extensible. It can be deployed in many environments such as local or remote Virtual Machines, bare metal, or in public/private/hybrid/multi-cloud setups. It supports and it is supported by many 3rd party open source tools which enhance Kubernetes' capabilities and provide a feature-rich experience to its users.

Kubernetes' architecture is modular and pluggable. Not only that it orchestrates modular, decoupled microservices type applications, but also its architecture follows decoupled microservices patterns. Kubernetes' functionality can be extended by writing custom resources, operators, custom APIs, scheduling rules or plugins.

For a successful open source project, the community is as important as having great code. Kubernetes is supported by a thriving community across the world. It has more than 2,000 contributors, who, over time, have pushed over 77,000 commits. There are meet-up groups in different cities and countries which meet regularly to discuss Kubernetes and its ecosystem. There are *Special Interest Groups* (SIGs), which focus on special topics, such as scaling, bare metal, networking, etc. We will talk more about them in our last chapter, *Kubernetes Communities*.
