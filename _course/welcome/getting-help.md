For any **technical issues** with the edX platform (including login problems and issues with the Verified Certificate), please use the Help icon located on the upper right side of your screen.

One great way to interact with peers taking this course and resolving any **content-related issues** is via the Discussion Forums. These forums can be used in the following ways:

-   To discuss concepts, tools, and technologies presented in this course, or related to the topics discussed in the course material.
-   To ask questions about course content.
-   To share resources and ideas related to Kubernetes.

We strongly encourage you not only to ask questions, but to share with your peers opinions about the course content, as well as valuable related resources. The Discussion Forums will be reviewed periodically by The Linux Foundation staff, but it is primarily a community resource, not an 'ask the instructor' service.

***Note:** Before starting a thread about your issue, we strongly encourage you to do a quick search to see if your question has already been addressed. It's often the case that there will be one or two threads asking the same question that has been answered.*

To learn more tips on how to use them, read the following article: "*[Getting the Most Out of the edX Discussion Forums](https://blog.edx.org/getting-most-out-edx-discussion-forums)*".
